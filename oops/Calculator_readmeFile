## **Calculator Program**

This Python program implements a simple command-line calculator. Users can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

---

### **Features**
- Perform **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**.
- Input validation to handle invalid choices.
- Handles division by zero gracefully.

---

### **Usage Instructions**

1. **Run the Program**  
   Execute the Python script in your terminal or any Python IDE.

2. **Choose an Operation**  
   Select one of the following options:
   - Enter `1` for Addition
   - Enter `2` for Subtraction
   - Enter `3` for Multiplication
   - Enter `4` for Division

3. **Input Numbers**  
   Enter two numbers when prompted.

4. **View Result**  
   The program will display the result of the selected operation.

5. **Invalid Inputs**  
   If an invalid choice is entered, the program will prompt you to enter a valid choice.

---

### **Code Workflow**

1. The user selects an operation from the displayed menu.
2. The program validates the user's choice:
   - If the choice is invalid (not between 1 and 4), an error message is displayed.
   - If valid, the user is prompted to enter two numbers.
3. The program performs the selected operation using the `Calculator` class and displays the result.

### **Example Run**

```plaintext
Enter Your Choice
Enter 1 For Sum
Enter 2 For Sub
Enter 3 For Mul
Enter 4 For Div
Enter 1 to 4 to use the Calculator: 2
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 3
SUBTRACTION is: 7
```

---

### **Error Handling**
- If the user enters an invalid choice, the program displays:  
  `Enter a Valid Choice Number`
- If division by zero is attempted, the program displays:  
  `Division by zero is not allowed.`

---

### **Pre-requisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

---

### **How to Run**
1. Save the script as `calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

---

### **Future Enhancements**
- Add more operations like modulus, exponentiation, and square root.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Allow continuous operations without restarting the program.
